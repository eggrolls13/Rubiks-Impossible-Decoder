# Rubiks-Impossible-Decoder
 Takes inputs of different color sets for each piece of a Rubik's Impossible, and finds all possible combinations of color sets that can map perfectly to the pieces of a normal Rubik's Cube.
Currently, the color sets of my own Rubik's Impossible are hard-coded into the program, but it would not be difficult to rework the program slightly to be able to work for any Rubik's Imposible, with color sets input through a scanner object.
